However, whoever you might be, without choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the world's wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can't help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful... Yes, at least, to the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness. \nA remaining piece of hope, a faint sign of wishes will be born from despairs."

    "quote": "It wasn't the pain that hurt me. Rather, it was the feeling of me being ripped apart, and the sound of the knife plunging deep, deep into my heart. That incomparably bittersweet fear. My body shook and trembled at the thought of it. My silent weeping contained my uneasiness, my loneliness, my will to live. My tears aren't from the pain either, or from the fear of the encounter. It was for the brush of death that I had never before experienced, but had now fallen in love with, even though I pray every night for the strength to live."

Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals."

When a certain traveler left on a journey in search of what he desired, he was told by his teacher: \"You mustn't lose your way, because if you make one wrong turn - you will never find what you were searching for\". But, unfortunately, the traveler lost his way and hung his head in dismay... But when he raised his head again, what he saw before him was a world even more magnificent than what the traveler was searching for. It means if you don't make mistakes, there are things you won't discover."

I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest. I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent. Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the closest existence to \"void\" that I had ever laid eyes on. I sank my body... into... that great \"void\". There was nothing there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing, and having nothing to lose. If that isn't \"happiness\", then what is? The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes, do not exist. There is nothing... in you... and... in me."

We've found the untouched realm of God. You have to look now, it's your only chance. Nothing is here yet, not even air or water to ruin. Soon the next man will follow to touch it, and another, and in all the rush, we may again destroy it. Maybe our killing comes from the madness of being confined. Please listen, there's no more reason to kill because we don't have any more borders now! Can anyone hear me? If you can hear me, then pray. The humblest of all things, the most noble \u2013 pray for each step you take. Make a path that is safe so that those who follow you will never stumble. Dear God, please give us your mercy - mercy for we are lost. Forgive the irresponsible, the trivial men who beg you from the dark for the forgiveness of your light."

I wanted to destroy it with my own hands. The exact same thing Akatsuki is trying to do today. But one man, one ninja from Konoha stopped me. I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow Jinchuuriki... He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will! There are no enemies here because we've all suffered at Akatsuki's hand! SO THERE IS NO SAND, NO STONE, NO LEAF, NO MIST, NO CLOUD! THERE ARE ONLY SHINOBI! And if you still hold a grudge against the Sand, then when this war is over, come and take my head instead! Our enemies are after the friend who saved my life! If they take him, if we hand him over, our world is finished! I want to protect him, and I want to protect our world! But I'm too young to protect it all on my own! All of you lend me your aid!"

Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it's someone you don't care about, you won't notice you've hurt them. What's important is your awareness of it. It's because you care about them, that you feel like you've hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you'll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that's not something to be sad about, I think it's probably something to be proud of."
