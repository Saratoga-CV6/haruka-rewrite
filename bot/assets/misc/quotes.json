If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all.

And then... There was nothing to me, except my eyes. I felt nothing. No rather... It was possible that what I felt was \"void\", yet. I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest. I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent. Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the closest existence to \"void\" that I had ever laid eyes on. I sank my body... into... that great \"void\". There was nothing there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing, and having nothing to lose. If that isn't \"happiness\", then what is? The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes, do not exist.
